# Configuration Fragment : Extract groupsResponseTime time    #
# ----------------------------------------------------------- #
# This fragment installs a EventAttributeTracker that is      #
# going to write the timing response of the groups endpoint   #
# to the groups response endpoint.                            #

# Tracker configuration
# ===========================

  # We are writing down the value measured by the HTTPTimingObserver as a metric
  # The observer is emitting a `HTTPTimingResultEvent` when the sampling is
  # completed, so we are getting event values and storing them as metrics
